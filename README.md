# pttp (power to the polder)

crazy ideas, refined

# abstract

building a compute facility for inference requires both power and cooling.
furthermore, it's difficult to do this cost-effectively for a single, startup-scale
company. so the best solution is to build more capacity than a startup would
need, and then lease/share the excess capacity with other organizations that
need that amount of computation.

however, the power requirements of a small-scale datacenter are not so great
that they cannot be accomplished with solar power. deciding to go with solar
power generated on-site, and supplementing with green energy from renewables
available on-grid such as wind creates a surplus of energy, which can be stored
in batteries, and it allows for the return of surplus heat to a district heating
network (*stadsverwarming*).

another interesting consequence of having surplus heat is it can be used for
another industrial process that integrates well with agriculture: fractionated
vapor distillation of ethanol from agricultural waste (such as fruit crops).

the combination of these factors makes a small-scale data facility not just
carbon-neutral, but carbon-negative and tightly integrated with the local
agricultural community (such as in flevoland).

The Tiny Datacenter and Pumpkin Patch

- four hectares in the zeewolde area, near almere, which was to be the site
  of a hyperscale meta datacenter, which was eventually abandoned
- buried 20kL coolant reservoir
- two 40m x 10m x 2 storeys buildings for offices, coworking, and shared
  - workspace for facility staff
  - solar roofs
- light agricultural mixed use (poplar, apple, pear)
- fermentation/distillation plant with hot-water loop from datacenter cooling
- pond with stocked zalmforel for cooling and public use
  - adjacent park with seasonal pumpkin patch (*pompoenplukplekje*)
- bicycle access to reduce vehicle commute
- buried 40-foot TEUs in bermed "berths" for forklift-in, forklift-out operation
  - 2x compute (inference, gpu, storage)
  - 1x EnerC 1.2GWh containerized battery
- 400-800 m^2 of solar = 7-14kW
- return to grid of surplus solar power when batteries are nominal
- return to municipal grid of hot water
